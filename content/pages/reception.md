We are in both the pavilion and the waterside. There are paved trails from the parking lot at the main entrance to the pavilion, and down to the water. It is roughly {} miles from the parking lot to the pavilion.

We plan on providing an array of lawn games and other amusements, but we have the site for the entire day-- feel free to wander off and enjoy the park! There are trails, a sandy beach, and other lovely things you are entirely welcome to spend some time exploring.

This is an outdoor reception, so we might encounter weather. In case of light rain, we will remain under the pavilion. In case of thunder or snowstorms, we will be relocating to a rain site. 


There is a restroom available at the pavilion.
