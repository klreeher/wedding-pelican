## TODO:

### content
- better planning re: rsvp form

- ideal rsvp form:
    * you enter the name on the invite
    * you get either "yay we know you come on in" or "sorry, we don't know you"
    * 

### design
- how do you customize bulrush's colors?
- why is text formatting so weird on wedding&reception page
- 

### publishing
- best practice for publishing output to server
- subdomain for wedding site or nah?
